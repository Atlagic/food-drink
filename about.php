						<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
						<h5>Pub is a gastropub built on a foundation of love of family, friends and food!<br/>
							Although our hope is to bring a restaurant that we have always wanted to <br/>
							frequent in our neighborhood but has not been available for us, it was our love of family <br/> 
							that brought two cousins together—each one bringing a key component to the creation of Pub. <br/>
						</h5><br/>
						<h5>Chris Frate, owner and lifelong resident, was a bartender and manager of a bar.<br/>
						The bartending bug never left Chris, and he has always wanted <br/>
						to get back behind the bar keeping customers happy. Even though his role is now as an owner,<br/> 
						you are sure to see Chris behind the bar where he feels most comfortable.Nick Frate, chef, has been in the culinary <br/>
						industry since he started working at his dad’s restaurant as a kid. Nick has trained under very-talented chefs and <br/>
						brings his own talent and passion for creating food to his kitchen at Pub. The stars aligned, and these two cousins <br/>
						were able to bring their dreams together and open Pub.<br/></h5>
